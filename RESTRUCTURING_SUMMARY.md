  - Navigation links in the center (Dashboard, Crops & IoT, Weather & AI, Community)
  - Search bar for desktop users
  - User profile, notifications, and logout on the right
  - Responsive mobile menu with hamburger toggle
  - Mobile-optimized navigation with search and user controls

### 2. Updated Layout Component (`components/layout/Layout.tsx`)
- **Restructured**: Completely redesigned to use horizontal layout
- **Changes**:
  - Removed sidebar and header dependencies
  - Now uses the new Navbar component
  - Simplified structure with flexbox layout
  - Added Footer component for complete page structure

### 3. New Footer Component (`components/layout/Footer.tsx`)
- **Created**: A clean footer with branding and copyright information
- **Features**:
  - Consistent branding with logo

### 4. Layout Structure
The new layout follows this structure:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│              Navbar                 │ ← Horizontal navigation
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                     │
│                                     │
│              Content                │ ← All pages display here
│                                     │
│                                     │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│              Footer                 │ ← Site footer
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```
